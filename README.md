## Assignment 1

   1. Enviornments and Search Algorithms
      Generating a Maze.
      Trying to Solve it using different Search Techniques(BFS< DFS, A*, BIBFS)

   2. Analysis and Comparison of Different Search Algorithms


   3. Generating Hard Mazes using Genetic ALgorithm and its Analysis


   4. What if the Maze was on Fire? 
      Consider a Maze where the runner starts running from the left corner end 
      and there is a fire starting from the right corner, How would you solve the Maze?
